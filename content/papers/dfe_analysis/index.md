##### Abstract

This brief discusses the limitation of previously pub-
lished statistical decision feedback equalizer (DFE) models when
residual inter-symbol interference (ISI) is present and proposes
a method that overcomes this limitation. The paper presents
an accurate closed-form expression for the DFE with residual
ISI and additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). The analysis
is extended to 4-level pulse amplitude modulation (PAM-4) to
cover serial links of current interest. The results verify that the
proposed model estimates an accurate bit error rate (BER).
