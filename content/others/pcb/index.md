##### Github Link:

https://github.com/kunmok/pcb-for-128GSPS-adc-based-serdes

This is a PCB board I designed to test my 128 GS/s ADC-based SerDes receiver chip fabricated using Intel16 process. You can find additional details through the link, including the schematic, test plan, fabrication drawings, and bill of materials (BOM).

The PCB was fabricated by iPCB (China) and assembled—both components and BGA—by RushPCB (USA).

I also plan to upload the FPGA firmware and test scripts used in this project, so stay tuned!
